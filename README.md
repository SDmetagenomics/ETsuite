# ETsuite
Is a suite of tools that can be used to analyze data generated from an ET-seq experiment. The workflow can also be adapted for identifying and quantifying insertion junctions in a set of genomes that have had foreign DNA introduced via guided or unguided transposition. 

ETsuite is still in active development so we currently provide no guarantees on its functionallity and outputs.
