## v0.10.1 ##
- updated bam_pe_stats.py to return mismatches at start of forward read

- updated ETmapper.R to identify presence of terminal 5 bases of known model sequence in
  trimmed models
	> added function substrRight()

- Updated filtering of reads to incorporate fwd read Tn-Junction mismatches and terminal
  model base identity filtering to combat chimeric reads 

- Updated bowtie mapping gap penalties to disallow gap formation during read mapping "--rdg 60,3 --rfg 60,3". Thus the CLIPPED output column should now always be 0

- Added option to toggle on and off the chimeric read filtering "-C" for use with datasets where fwd read is too short to capture junction. 	

- Updated contributors

- Created ETmapper Dev version for future feature testing...may remove and use branches


## v0.10 ##
